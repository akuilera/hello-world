# hello-world
This is my first repository!

I'm learning how to use GitHub to share projects!

I learned Machine Learning on freeCodeCamp, Mechanical Engineering on the Universidad Central de Venezuela and have always been making music.

I can speak Spanish as my mother language, English fluently and German at an medium-advanced level.
